This can include monitoring contributions, managing repositories, and maintaining an active presence on the platform. The issue is compounded for developers working on multiple projects or collaborating with different teams.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re experiencing an issue where after creating a new repository, the initial activity shows up on your profile and others can see it. However, subsequent commits or updates to the repository do not appear in the activity feed.</p>
<p>You can solved this problem to follow this process:</p>
<pre><code>    1. Go to setting
    2. Find Email and Go to Email
    3. Find Backup email address and mark it for Only allow primary Email then save it.
</code></pre>
<p>Now refresh your profile. Update or write something and add this repository then push github. Check your activity, I think solved your problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover you can face others problem, this can be due to several reasons. Let&rsquo;s diagnose and address this issue step by step.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="potential-causes-and-solutions">Potential Causes and Solutions</h4>
<p><strong>1. Commit Email Mismatch</strong></p>
<p>If your commits are not associated with your GitHub account due to an email mismatch, they won&rsquo;t appear in your activity feed.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
Verify that the email address used in your local Git configuration matches the email associated with your GitHub account.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check your current Git email:</p>
<pre><code>  git config --global user.email
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it needs updating, set it correctly:</p>
<pre><code>  git config --global user.email &quot;your-email@example.com&quot;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure the email is verified on GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your GitHub profile settings.</li>
<li>Under &ldquo;Emails&rdquo;, make sure your email address is listed and verified.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Commit Visibility</strong></p>
<p>If your commits are part of a pull request that hasn’t been merged yet, they might not show up in your activity feed until the pull request is merged.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that the commits are directly pushed to the main branch or that the pull requests containing them are merged.</p>
<p><strong>3. GitHub Caching and Delays</strong></p>
<p>GitHub activity feeds might experience delays due to caching. Sometimes, activities might not appear immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Wait for a while to see if the activity appears. Try refreshing the page or logging out and back in.</p>
<p><strong>4. Repository Visibility</strong></p>
<p>Ensure the repository visibility has not changed unexpectedly. If a repository is private, only you and collaborators can see the activity.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Confirm the repository is still public if it was meant to be so.</p>
<p><strong>5. Commit to the Correct Branch</strong></p>
<p>Ensure you are committing and pushing changes to the correct branch (typically the main or master branch) that you are expecting to track activity from.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Check your branch before committing:
git branch
Switch to the correct branch if needed:
git checkout main</p>
<h3 id="step-by-step-example">Step-by-Step Example</h3>
<p>Let’s walk through a typical commit process to ensure everything is set correctly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Configure Git with Correct Email:</p>
<pre><code> git config --global user.email &quot;your-email@example.com&quot; 
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a New Repository:</p>
<pre><code> mkdir new-repo
 cd new-repo
 git init
 echo &quot;# New Repo&quot; &gt; README.md
 git add README.md
 git commit -m &quot;Initial commit&quot;
 git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/new-repo.git
 git push -u origin main
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequent Commits:</p>
<pre><code> echo &quot;Some changes&quot; &gt; file.txt
 git add file.txt
 git commit -m &quot;Added file.txt&quot;
 git push origin main
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify Repository and Branch:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ensure the repository is public on GitHub.
Verify you are on the main branch:</p>
<pre><code>    git branch
</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Wait and Refresh:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Wait a few minutes and refresh your GitHub profile page.</li>
<li>Log out and back in if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these steps, you should be able to ensure that your subsequent commits and activity are correctly displayed on your GitHub profile and others can see them as well. If the problem persists, it might be worth reaching out to GitHub support for further assistance.</p>
